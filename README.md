# Chat with Web Sockets

## Project Description

This project is a simple chat application developed to showcase my backend skills using Node.js with Socket.io and Express. The main focus was on implementing real-time communication functionalities using WebSockets. The frontend design is intentionally minimalist and functional, without an emphasis on aesthetics, highlighting the robustness of client-server communication.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Socket.io**
- **Express**

## Key Features
- Real-time connection between multiple users
- Basic login system where users can join the chat
- Notifications when a user joins or leaves the chat
- Real-time message sending and receiving
- Dynamic update of the connected users list

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-websockets.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd chat-with-websockets
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter your username to join the chat.
3. Start sending messages in real-time with other connected users.

## My Role
In this project, I was responsible for all stages, from server setup and WebSocket logic implementation to creating the basic frontend for user interactions. The main goal was to demonstrate efficiency in real-time communication and the ability to manage multiple simultaneous connections.

## Challenges Overcome
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the system could correctly manage the state of connected users, especially when dealing with disconnect and reconnect events. I used Socket.io to handle these events efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Impact and Results
This project serves as a clear example of my backend skills, particularly in creating real-time applications. It demonstrates my ability to use modern technologies to build effective and robust solutions, preparing me to tackle complex challenges in larger projects.
